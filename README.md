<h2>Discord server setup</h2>

To set up your Discord server for the bot, follow these steps:

1. **Create Channels for Features**:  
    Organize your server by creating dedicated text channels for each feature the bot provides. Here are the recommended channel names:
    - `#dice` for dice rolls.
    - `#spells` for accessing the 5e spell list.
    - `#class` for exploring 5e classes.

2. **Set Permissions**:  
    Ensure that the bot has the necessary permissions to read and send messages in these channels. You can do this by:
    - Right-clicking on the channel.
    - Selecting "Edit Channel" > "Permissions".
    - Adding the bot's role and enabling "Read Messages" and "Send Messages".

3. **Invite the Bot to Your Server**:  
    Use the bot's invite link to add it to your server. Make sure to grant it the required permissions during the invitation process.

4. **Test the Channels**:  
    Once the bot is added, test each channel by typing what you are looking for.
    For example:  
    - In `#dice`, try a dice roll command like `d20`.
    - In `#spells`, search for a spell using `fireball` or `fireb` for Fireball spell description.
    - In `#class`, explore a class with `wizard abjuration` or `wiz abj` for Wizard Abjuration class/subclass.

This setup ensures a clean and organized server for your DnD sessions!
